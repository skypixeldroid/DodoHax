# DodoHax (Ice Dodo Hacks)
Game Hack for the browser game Ice Dodo

Features:

-Invincibility
-Able to jump all the time
-Can keep your game progress that you have currently*

-Pressing "Space" to restart
-Pressing "Space" to go to next map
These bugs will be fixed soon!

*You can only keep your current progress if:
A) You have NOT sync'd your extention with Ice Dodo's website
B) It will be harder, and you'll have to know where your extentions are stored in your browser.

Browsers that are NOT supported are: Old Versions of MS Edge (which use MSHTML), Any version of FireFox, any browser that doesn't use Chromium
